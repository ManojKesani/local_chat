**Time Series Forecasting (Stationary Data)**
=============================================

### Introduction

* Time series analysis: analyzing past behavior of data to predict its future behavior (extrapolation)
* Examples: Dow Jones Industrial Averages, historical data on sales, inventory, customer counts, interest rates, and costs
* A time-series data is a set of observations on a quantitative variable collected over time

### Stationary Data

* No significant trend, non-explosive, non-wandering
* Examples: sales data with no trend or seasonality

### Nonstationary Data

* Significant upward/downward trend, wandering up and down over time
* Examples: stock prices, population growth

### Seasonal Data

* Repeating patterns at regular intervals over time
* Examples: sales of winter clothing, ice cream sales
* Two types of seasonal effects:
	+ Additive effects
	+ Multiplicative effects

### Extrapolation Model

* General form: 𝑌𝑡+1 = 𝑓(𝑌𝑡, 𝑌𝑡−1, 𝑌𝑡−2, …)
* Goal: identify the function 𝑓(⋅) that produces the most accurate forecast of future values of 𝑌

### Measuring Accuracy

* Informal approach: constructing line graphs that show the actual value versus the predicted values for various modeling techniques
* Formal techniques:
	+ Minimizing Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)
	+ Minimizing Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE)
	+ Minimizing Mean Square Error (MSE)
	+ Minimizing Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)

### Stationary Models: An Example

* The manager of Electra-City wants to estimate the number of DVRs the store will sell in the next four months
* He has collected sales data for the past 24 months

### Moving Average (MA) Technique

* The MA technique is the simplest forecasting method
* MA over the past 𝑘 periods: 𝑌𝑡+1 = (𝑌𝑡 + 𝑌𝑡−1 + ⋯ + 𝑌𝑡−𝑘+1) / 𝑘
* Note: No general rule for determining the best 𝑘 exists. We must try out several 𝑘 values to see what works best.

### Weighted Moving Average (WMA) Technique

* The WMA technique allows different weights to be assigned to past values
* 𝑌𝑡+1 = 𝑤0𝑌𝑡 + 𝑤1𝑌𝑡−1 + ⋯ + 𝑤𝑘𝑌𝑡−𝑘
* Where 0 ≤ 𝑤𝑖 ≤ 1 and ∑𝑤𝑖 = 1

### Exponential Smoothing Technique

* Exponential smoothing is another averaging technique for stationary data
* 𝑌𝑡+1 = 𝛼𝑌𝑡 + (1 - 𝛼)𝑌𝑡−1
* Where 0 ≤ 𝛼 ≤ 1

### Seasonality

* Seasonality: a regular and repeating pattern in time series data
* Examples: fuel oil price jumps up during the winter, price of suntan lotion and ice cream increases during the summer
* Two types of seasonal effects:
	+ Additive effects
	+ Multiplicative effects

### Forecasting Stationary Data with Additive Seasonal Effects

* Let 𝑝 = the number of seasonal periods (𝑝 = 4 in quarterly data)
* The expected level at period 𝑡 is the weighted average of the de-seasonalized value at 𝑡 and the expected level at 𝑡−1:
	+ 𝐸𝑡 = 𝛼𝑌𝑡 - 𝑆𝑡−𝑝 + (1 - 𝛼)𝐸𝑡−1
* The seasonal factor at period 𝑡 is the weighted average of the expected seasonal effect at period 𝑡 and the seasonal factor at period 𝑡−𝑝:
	+ 𝑆𝑡 = 𝛽𝑌𝑡 - 𝐸𝑡 + (1 - 𝛽)𝑆𝑡−𝑝
* The predicted value at period 𝑡+𝑛 (for 𝑛 = 1, 2, …, 𝑝) is:
	+ 𝑌𝑡+𝑛 = 𝐸𝑡 + 𝑆𝑡+𝑛−𝑝

### Forecasting Stationary Data with Multiplicative Seasonal Effects

* Let 𝑝 = the number of seasonal periods (𝑝 = 4 in quarterly data)
* The expected level at period 𝑡 is the weighted average of the de-seasonalized value at 𝑡 and the expected level at 𝑡−1:
	+ 𝐸𝑡 = 𝛼𝑌𝑡 / 𝑆𝑡−𝑝 + (1 - 𝛼)𝐸𝑡−1
* The seasonal factor at period 𝑡 is the weighted average of the expected seasonal effect at period 𝑡 and the seasonal factor at period 𝑡−𝑝:
	+ 𝑆𝑡 = 𝛽𝑌𝑡 / 𝐸𝑡 + (1 - 𝛽)𝑆𝑡−𝑝
* The predicted value at period 𝑡+𝑛 (for 𝑛 = 1, 2, …, 𝑝) is:
	+ 𝑌𝑡+𝑛 = 𝐸𝑡 × 𝑆𝑡+𝑛−𝑝
