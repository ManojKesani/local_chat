**Sentence Embeddings and Their Role in NLP**
=====================================================

### What are Sentence Embeddings?

Sentence embeddings are numerical representations of sentences, capturing their meaning in a high-dimensional space.

### Role of Sentence Embeddings in NLP

* Crucial for understanding the meaning and context of text in NLP
* Provide a way to quantify and compare whole sentences/documents beyond individual words
* Enhance various NLP tasks, including:
	+ Semantic textual similarity (STS)
	+ Finding questions similar to a new question
	+ Semantic search
	+ Clustering (topic modeling)

### From W2VEC to Sentence Embeddings

* Example of sentence embeddings using W2VEC:
	+ No: [1,0,0,0]
	+ I: [0,2,0,0]
	+ Am: [-1,0,1,0]
	+ Good: [0,0,1,3]
	+ "No, I am good!": [0,2,2,3]
	+ "I am No good!": [0,2,2,3]

### Cross-Encoder (BERT) vs. Bi-Encoder (SBERT)

* Cross-Encoder (BERT):
	+ Suitable for pair regression tasks
	+ Requires n·(n−1)/2 inference computations for finding the most similar sentence pair in a collection of n sentences
* Bi-Encoder (SBERT):
	+ More efficient for computing sentence embeddings
	+ Enables fast semantic search and clustering

### Siamese Network Architectures

* Cross-Encoder Architecture:
	+ Uses the CLS token as sentence representation
	+ Averages the BERT output layer
* Bi-Encoder Architecture (Siamese Network):
	+ Uses two separate encoders for sentence A and sentence B
	+ Computes the similarity score between the two sentence embeddings

### Loss Functions for Siamese Network

* Cross-Entropy Loss Function:
	+ Suitable for NLI dataset
	+ Computes the similarity score between sentence A and sentence B
* Regression Loss Function (MSE):
	+ Suitable for regression tasks
	+ Computes the similarity score between sentence A and sentence B
* Triplet Loss Function:
	+ Suitable for triplet mining
	+ Computes the similarity score between sentence A, sentence B, and sentence C

### Applications of BERT and SBERT

* BERT (Cross-Encoder) Applications:
	+ Customer Support Automation
	+ Legal Document Analysis
	+ Quality Control in Manufacturing
* SBERT (Bi-Encoder) Applications:
	+ Semantic Search Engines
	+ Content Recommendation Systems
	+ Data Deduplication
	+ Real-time Social Media Monitoring

### Key Points to Understand

* Sentence embeddings are crucial for understanding the meaning and context of text in NLP
* BERT and SBERT are two different architectures for computing sentence embeddings
* BERT is suitable for pair regression tasks, while SBERT is more efficient for computing sentence embeddings
* Siamese network architectures can be used for computing similarity scores between sentence pairs
* Various loss functions can be used for training Siamese networks, including cross-entropy, regression, and triplet loss functions.
